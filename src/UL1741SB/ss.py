1741SB 4.3.1:
In determining that steady state conditions have been reached, and unless otherwise stated in SB,
IEEE 1547-2018 or IEEE 1547.1-2021 for a particular function, the definitions in SB2 apply with the following:

The steady state value is the average magnitude calculated by averaging the RMS measurements of the
observed parameter over an averaging period as follows:

i) For functions which include a specified open loop response time the average value shall be calculated over
a period of not less than three times the specified open loop response time and starting at a time not less
than one times the open loop response time.

ii) For functions which have tests involving step changes, and that do not include a specified open loop response
time the average shall be calculated over a period of not less than three times the observed response time and
starting at a time not less than one times the observed response time.

iii) For functions in which there is no step change or observable response, the average shall be calculated over a
period of not less than three times the time required in the applicable test requirements for the specific function.
